This plugin should be able to provide users these functionalities:
	1. Load pre-build dictionaries for correction
	2. Create their own dictionaries
	3. Modify dictionaries (adding, removing fields)

There should also be an option to enable and disable the "completion"

TODO:

1. Move autoloading to the autoload directory
